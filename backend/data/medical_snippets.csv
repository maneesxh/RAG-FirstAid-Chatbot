Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition causing absolute insulin deficiency.,
Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance and relative insulin insufficiency.,
Gestational diabetes develops in pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery.,
A fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL on two occasions confirms diabetes.,
Hypoglycaemia is defined as blood glucose < 70 mg/dL and needs rapid glucose intake.,
First-aid for mild hypoglycaemia: give 15 g of fast-acting carbohydrate such as glucose tablets.,
"For severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness, give intramuscular glucagon 1 mg if available.",
Metformin is first-line pharmacotherapy for most adults with Type 2 diabetes.,
Insulin aspart starts to lower glucose within 15 minutes of subcutaneous injection.,
Long-acting insulin glargine provides basal coverage for approximately 24 hours.,
"Diabetic ketoacidosis presents with high blood glucose, ketones, and metabolic acidosis.",
First-aid priority in ketoacidosis is rapid transfer to emergency care do **not** delay.,
Foot ulcers in diabetics require daily inspection and early antibiotic therapy if infected.,
HbA1c reflects average glucose over roughly three months target < 7 % for most adults.,
Regular aerobic exercise improves insulin sensitivity in Type 2 diabetes.,
ACE inhibitors protect kidney function in diabetic nephropathy.,
Retinopathy screening is advised annually for diabetic patients.,
SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular and renal events in high-risk diabetics.,
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state lacks ketones but causes extreme dehydration.,
Ingesting high-sugar drinks in hyperosmolar state can worsen dehydration.,
Sudden chest pain radiating to the left arm may indicate myocardial infarction.,
Call emergency services immediately at the first suspicion of heart attack.,
Chewable aspirin 160–325 mg is recommended if no contraindication to antiplatelets.,
Sublingual nitroglycerin can relieve angina repeat every five minutes up to three doses.,
Do **not** give nitroglycerin if systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg.,
Ventricular fibrillation is a shockable rhythm requiring early defibrillation.,
High-quality CPR compressions: depth 5–6 cm at 100–120 compressions per minute.,
Automated external defibrillators give voice prompts and will not shock without need.,
Beta-blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand post-infarction.,
Heart-failure first aid focuses on sitting the patient upright and giving oxygen if available.,
Edema and sudden weight gain can signal worsening heart failure.,
ACE inhibitors and ARBs improve survival in systolic heart failure.,
Atrial fibrillation raises stroke risk oral anticoagulation is often indicated.,
Clopidogrel is an alternative antiplatelet for aspirin-intolerant patients.,
Statins lower LDL cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular events.,
Left-sided heart failure commonly causes pulmonary congestion and dyspnoea.,
Right-sided heart failure leads to peripheral edema and jugular venous distension.,
Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease.,
Cardiac enzymes such as troponin I rise within 3–4 hours of myocardial infarction.,
Post-MI rehabilitation includes gradual exercise under supervision.,
"Kidneys regulate fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and acid-base status.",
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is often triggered by dehydration, infection, or nephrotoxic drugs.",
A rise in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours indicates AKI.,
First-aid for suspected AKI: stop nephrotoxic medications and ensure adequate hydration.,
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is staged by estimated GFR Stage 5 is < 15 mL/min/1.73 m².,
Uncontrolled hypertension accelerates CKD progression.,
Dietary sodium restriction (< 2 g/day) lowers fluid overload in CKD.,
Hyperkalaemia (> 5.5 mmol/L) in CKD may require calcium gluconate and insulin–glucose infusion.,
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents treat anaemia of CKD when iron is adequate.,
ACE inhibitors slow CKD progression but can transiently raise creatinine.,
Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneal membrane for solute exchange.,
Haemodialysis requires vascular access and anticoagulation with heparin.,
Renal transplant offers best long-term survival for ESRD patients.,
NSAIDs can precipitate AKI by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis.,
Proteinuria > 1 g/day is a marker of glomerular disease.,
Phosphate binders reduce hyperphosphataemia in CKD.,
CKD patients should receive annual influenza vaccination.,
Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of ESRD worldwide.,
Contrast-induced nephropathy risk is lowered by IV hydration pre- and post-procedure.,
Kidney-friendly diet limits potassium-rich foods such as bananas and spinach.,
